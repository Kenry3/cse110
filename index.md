## Self Introduction
>**Basic Info: I am currently a sophomore majoring computer science, to learn more about me, checkout this [relative link](/README.md). And this is a picture of me on a hiking trip &darr;**
![Image](me.jpeg)

*As shown in the picture, I like hiking(most of time individually) a lot since I can always find my peace by wandering in the silence of nature. Besides, I enjoy competitive sports and video games to refresh my mind from intense schoolwork. As a programmer, I like learning various alogrithms and use them to solve interesting quesiton, if you are also into solving fun problems, check out my [leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/Kenry/) : )*
